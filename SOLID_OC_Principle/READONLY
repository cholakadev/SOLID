Open-Closed principle
-----------------------------

A class is opened for extension but closed for modification. In the example, we have ProductsFilter class and instead of adding new method in the class to filter by
different conditions, we are extending it by creating new different specifications for the different filters we want to apply and they are passed to the Filter method.
By doing this we are following the Open-Closed Principle.
